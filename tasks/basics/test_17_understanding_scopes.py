 Scopes and namespaces govern the accessibility rules and lifetime of python variables.

 Namespaces is a mapping of names to objects. Each python block creates a new namespace. The 3 python blocks are
 modules (files), functions and classes.

 An object can have many names in the same namespace
 An object can have names in different namespaces.

 Scope is a textual area in which a variable can be directly accessible by its name.

 Variable which are bound (created) in a block are called local variables in that block
 Variables which are scoped to the the whole file (module) are called global
 Variables which are scoped to outer functions (in case of nested functions) are called non-local or free.
